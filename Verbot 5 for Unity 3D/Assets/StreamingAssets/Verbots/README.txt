Verbot 5 README
------------------

Verbot® 5 comes with two applications. Verbot® 5 Player, and the Verbot Scripting
Interface (or editor).

Verbot® 5
The Verbot® loads knowledgebases and displays an animated character which can
be interacted with through text based conversation. Content within a
knowledgebase Rule allows the Verbot® character to open desktop applications,
as well as to perform various animations.

Verbot Scripting Interface
The Verbot Scripting Interface is used to create custom knowledgebases.
The easy to use interface allows you to create Rules which contain Inputs and
Outputs. Inputs can utlize Verbot® Synonym files to help make scripting a
breeze. Outputs can contain special tags which can open and run applications,
as well as animate the Verbot® in many ways.

With Verbot® 5 technology, creating your own intelligent agent becomes as
straightforward as typing a sentence or command in natural language text.
The online help manual includes information which will quickly get you up to
speed with creating your own Verbot® personality. Of course you don't have to
create your own Verbot® Knowledgebase, but doing so is half the fun!
